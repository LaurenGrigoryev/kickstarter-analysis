# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
I analyzed outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns for theater projects based on launch dates and goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends in fundraising for Kickstarter theater projects. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I performed my analysis by pulling data on theater projects that were successful in meeting fundraising goals, failed to meet goals, or were canceled, and I looked for trends over time based on project launch date. I displayed my findings by month in a line chart for quick visualization.

I displayed my findings by $5,000 increments in a line chart for quick visualization.

My first challenge was to display launch dates by time of year using the month versus year to year. Data consistently showed trends based on time of year, so I converted the time stamps given in UNIX code of launch dates to short-form dates, and place 

## Results
- What are two conclusions that you can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes Based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
